        Welcome to my personal blog! This website is a space where I share my
        experiences in gaming, coding projects, and my everyday school life.
        Creating this blog helps me express myself and improve my web design skills.
    </p>

    <p>
        Here, you will find blog posts about my favorite games, photos that inspire me,
        and a short story about who I am. I created this blog as part of a performance task
        and to practice HTML and CSS.
